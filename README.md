# Python Paint Application with OpenCV

This project is a simple Python-based paint application using the OpenCV library. It allows users to draw with the mouse in a window, change drawing color using trackbars, adjust the brush thickness with the mouse wheel, and save their drawings.

## Features

- **Drawing with the Mouse**: Click and drag the mouse to draw on the canvas.
- **Erasing with Mouse**: To erase the image, hold down the right mouse button and move over the area to be erased. You can also change the size of the eraser using the mouse wheel.
- **Color Change**: Adjust the R, G, B values using the trackbars to change the drawing color.
- **Brush Thickness Adjustment**: Use the mouse wheel to increase or decrease the brush thickness.
- **Save Drawing**: Press 's' to save the current drawing as an image file.
- **Quit Application**: Press 'q' to close the application.
