# Python Paint Application with OpenCV

This project is a simple Python-based paint application using the OpenCV library. It allows users to draw with the mouse in a window, change drawing color using trackbars, adjust the brush thickness with the mouse wheel, and save their drawings.

## Features

- **Drawing with the Mouse**: Click and drag the mouse to draw on the canvas.
- **Color Change**: Adjust the R, G, B values using the trackbars to change the drawing color.
- **Brush Thickness Adjustment**: Use the mouse wheel to increase or decrease the brush thickness.
- **Save Drawing**: Press 's' to save the current drawing as an image file.
- **Quit Application**: Press 'q' to close the application.

## Usage
Execute the Python script from your terminal or IDE to start the application. A window will open where you can start drawing.

Adjust the R, G, B trackbars to change the color of the brush. Use the mouse wheel to change the brush thickness. Click and drag the mouse across the window to draw.

## Saving the Image
To save the image you have drawn, press the 's' key. The image will be saved in the project directory with the name 'Saved_image.png'.

## Closing the Application
To close the application, press the 'q' key. The window will close, and the application will terminate.
